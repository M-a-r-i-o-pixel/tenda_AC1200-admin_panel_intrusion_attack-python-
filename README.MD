This is a script written in python that tries to access the admin panel of the router tenda AC1200 by guessing passwords.
I have configured some things before to make the attack easier and I have , for example , not implemented brute force even if the skeleton of it exists in my code.
  Just wordlist attacks until now. Also I do not have any paralelization yet, but maybe I will add it later or someone else will give a fork to my project.

I wrote this script only for educational purposes only. So don't expect a hydra lol
I just think that by trying to break things , you learn about them and how to protect them and how they work.
Would this not make a better world?
